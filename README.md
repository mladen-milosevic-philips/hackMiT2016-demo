# HackMiT 2016 demo app
A very simple android demo app based on Bluetooth Chat Sample. It samples accelerator at 50Hz and sends it to a connected Bluetooth device.

Accelerometer data are read and sent to a connected Bluetooth device in BluetoothSerialFragment, specifically in onSensorChanged method. All data are in m/sÂ²
